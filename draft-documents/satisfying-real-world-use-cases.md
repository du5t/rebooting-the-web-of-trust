Rebooting the Web of Trust

# Opportunities Created by WoT to Control and Leverage Personal Data

## Overview

This month (Nov 2015), Facebook's share price broke 100USD/share, for a total
valuation of 290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market
understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. On the other
hand, the now-conventional, absorb-everything design of Facebook in which users
are a passive producer to be milked, with no control of their data, is a blunt
one that only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of
information and identity.

Over the long term, there are limits to the amount of 'trust' (in almost any
sense of the word) a centralized authority can garner: democracies come with the
expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government, and the
imbalance of power between consumers and corporations is offset by class action
suits and regulatory bureaus--both punitive postures. A decentralized system
engineered *not* to concentrate power as it grows in size avoids this; web of
trust networks can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide
their assessments as input.

Distributed, self-sovereign, cryptographic protocols and structures offer
potential guarantees and applications that offer significantly more robustness,
portability, and versatility than centralized, escrowed, or less-secure
conventional processes.

One of the first technologies to offer this kind of promise emerged 25 years
ago: the "Web of Trust" that grew out of the decentralized, cryptographically
verified attestations of PGP users. Due to failures of UX design, the spread of
PGP was was confined to highly technical communities. Now is the time to extend
them to be usable by all who have access to digital networks and in particular
ensure that marginalized populations can benefit.

In light of light, we consider use cases with stringent demands that require
such robust systems. It is a fortunate tragedy that there is no shortage of
real-life examples of those in the world today. A large spectrum of individuals,
from marginalized persons like stateless refugees, victims of human trafficking,
to members of the informal or unregulated economy, urgently need to participate
in otherwise privileged economic and political fora, but they face technical,
economic, and political barriers to entry.

The essential problem is to connect burgeoning new technological developments
with unmet consumer needs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we present five use
cases, from two relatively simple cases of selective disclosure, to the most
extreme case of establishing government-verifiable credentials from zero for a
stateless refugee.

Basic technical/implementation needs are identified for each case, and a brief
solution sketch is offered. The potential user-experience for each use case is
also outlined. Finally, we examine common themes in discussion, and summarize
future prospects.

## Use Cases

1. Selective Disclosure: Proof of Age
2. Short-term Contracts with Memory: Distributed AirBnB
3. Bootstrapping Long-Term Identity: Creating A Record of Credit
    4. Concerns in Non-G20 Nations
5. Starting From Zero: Refugee
6. Human Trafficking: Exiting Safe Houses

### Use Case 1 - Selective Disclosure: Proof of Age ###

Beth wants to go to the club with her friends, but lately they've been
photographing all IDs at entry for 'reasons of liability.' Both club owners and
privacy-minded individuals like Beth are understandably concerned about how that
data will be stored and used. The current system requires that the individual
share an ID that gives not only their exact age but their name, address and
additional information unneeded in that context. Beth would like to provide the
minimum information needed to get in (proof that she is over 21 years of
age). The club owner would like to be able to prove later that all attendees
were over 21 years of age if needed, without incurring the liability of securing
the irrelevant personally identifying information (PII). The local government
would like to establish a minimum degree of verifiability of the club's records
without creating an undue liability issue for the club owner.

*Selective disclosure* refers to the process by which a credential holder like
Beth offers *only* the information actually needed by a service provider, for
only the scope (i.e., the amount of time) required for that information to serve
its purpose. Typically, this involves the substitution of a *verifiable claim*
for the actual credential itself; in the case of "proof of age", Beth could
submit a one-time claim responding to a request from the club that her age is in
fact over 21. The club owner need only check that the claim is valid.

A simple sketch of one process satisfying this requirement works as follows:

1. Beth receives a request from the club owner, containing a random unique
   number generated only for this purpose (a 'nonce').
2. Beth signs this number with a private key associated with her driver's
   license as well as a description of the claim she wants to make (i.e.,
   "birthdate earlier than 21 years prior to now"), creating a 'digest'.
3. Beth submits the resulting digest through secure channels to a decentralized
   store whose record of truth (and therefore credibility) is out of the control
   of any one actor, whether government or business. The only guarantee the
   store needs externally provisioned is availability (i.e., uptime).
4. The state checks the request from its end (perhaps by polling for requests)
   to see if it is valid (that it came from Beth and makes sense as a request),
   then signs the result and the nonce, inserting them both into the data store
   as a new digest available to Beth.
5. Beth provides the new digest to the club owner, who can then verify that the
   result was signed by the right authority.

Of course, the actual user experience of this is simple: Beth could scan a QR
code provided by the club owner, and approve the verification request through an
app on her phone. The result is then a different QR code the club owner can scan
to verify. All of the above technical back and forth happens in the background.

Note that at the end of this process, each of the third parties involved know
very little about Beth:

- The state agency storing Beth's driver's license data only knows that Beth
  needed to claim she was older than 21--not where that request came from
  (assuming communications metadata has been dealt with).
- The club owner only knows that the state agency agrees or disagrees with
  Beth's claim, and perhaps which state agency it is.

Expiry dates can be added to the data during each of the steps, ensuring that
data generated at any step is only meaningful in a certain time-limited context,
subject to the regulatory and social needs of stakeholders. Beth may make
adjustments to the request to ensure that the club owner and government are not
in collusion to deanonymize her from either direction. In this way, each of the
mechanisms that provide 'ground truth' or 'trust' are located in different parts
of the system, making it highly resistant to malicious action at any single
point or even a collection of points.

Variations on this theme have been published in academic literature for decades,
beginning with the "blind signatures" of David Chaum et al. (1983) and the "zero
knowledge proofs" of Goldwasser et al. (1985).



### Use Case 2 - Short-term Contracts with Memory: Distributed AirBnB ###

Tisha wants to rent an apartment from Joe for 2 weeks. They each need enough
validated information (such as a home address) about each other, to establish
identity, credit status, legal accountability, and some sort of letters of
reference that are relevant to the proposed transaction. They do not belong to
AirBnB, but would like to be able to create a similar level of assurance.

Tisha generates proof of:
    - Name
    - Legal residence
    - Good credit
    
...as well as (possibly anonymous or otherwise opaquely identified) letters of
reference that Joe can judge.

If Joe accepts Tisha's proofs, they establish a contract (possibly private
between them, at least initially) that sets out the terms of Tisha's stay. The
result of that contract (fulfilled or broken) can later be used in a similar
fashion for subsequent stays with others.

A simple sketch of a system that could satisfy these requirements is as follows:

1. Tisha maintains basic demographic identifiers securely as in Use Case 1, in a
   distributed, cryptographically verifiable, append-only repository.
2. Tisha and other users can 'bootstrap' some limited degree of reputability by
   having friends issue 'letters of reference' on her behalf, which could be as
   simple as ratings or actual letters submitted to the repository attached to
   their accounts.
3. Anytime Tisha arranges a short-term contract herself and relative strangers,
   she invites them to submit proof of the contract and its result, with a
   rating or comment, to the same repository. Contracts created in this fashion
   are linked in the data repository by incorporating signatures (or signature
   transactions) of all parties, once at establishment, and (optionally) once on
   fulfillment.

Note at throughout each of these exchanges, Joe and Tisha's respective privacy
is protected from each other until they are both ready to meet in person (if
they choose to do so), and then protected afterward. As a rule, personal private
information should never be shared directly--once data is copied to a location
out of its owner's control, no guarantees can be made of its security, and
mandated deletion is unfeasible.

Technology Possibilities

Contracts as mentioned above are a common application for decentralized
verifiable data stores: implementations targeting this area include the 'smart'
contracts of [Eris Industries](https://erisindustries.com/) and
[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), and the 'link' contracts of
[XDI](http://xdi.org/). Both of these types of offerings include expirable
permissions, and context-limited pseudonyms.

Users are both ready and willing to protect their identities in this fashion
during short-term arrangements: the AirBnB app collects an
[inordinate](http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2014/nov/14/airbnb-wont-let-book-room-facebook-friends)
and
[unacceptable amount](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/kris-constable/airbnb-privacy-security-id-jumio_b_4887509.html)
of
[personally identifying information](http://www.smh.com.au/business/turbulence-for-airbnb-over-privacy-concerns-20150216-13g8tm.html)
from its users. On the other hand, craigslist has included per-listing email
obfuscation for years now, and the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at
Harvard maintains
[a massive list of services and frameworks](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/development/)
that regard the user as the initial and final arbiter of information exchange.


### Use Case 3 - Bootstrapping Long-Term Identity: Creating a Record of Credit

Darla is a citizen of a G20 nation, but lacks a deposit account, extensive
credit history or reputable documentation of local residence. She can afford a
secure digital device however, and through it, she can sign up for an account
(whose marginal cost is close to zero). She would like to be able to store money
with a bank or other institution (credit union, etc.) and build a credit rating,
but can't meet current minimum requirements set by the bank through conventional
channels--[The 100 point scale is a common one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_point_check). In
other words, Darla needs to cross a 'gap' of credibility needed to enter the
conventional world of credentials.

In this case, the technical solution is similar to previous cases, excepting
that the desired result is the creation of a private credential whose main
purpose is to be a reusable link to a conventional financial record, held by the
account holder, of validity (in this context) equal to a fixed address. A
sketch:

1. An independent organization sets up a data store for storing verifiable
   claims submitted either by the state or Darla.
2. The independent organization onboards Darla and ensures she understands the
   guarantees of privacy offered, and that her credentials do not fundamentally
   depend on the state.
3. The state, in concert with the independent organization, signs Darla's
   initial claim, deeming it to be of sufficient strength to accomplish tasks
   like the above.
4. Darla submits proof of the state's approval of her established identity and
   any attributes (cf. use case 1) additionally required by the bank, and
   establishes a conventional account.

The systemic approach in this case is to check first the Know Your Client and
Anti-Money Laundering regulations of the jurisdiction or country that one aims
to approach. Once the regulatory compliance identity criteria are established,
identify the delta between the existing quality of identity and the required
quality of identity. Then build common processes for improving identity to a
level that passes the KYC/AML tests which are the chief barriers to accessing
established financial services.

Preserving low cost of access and progressive establishment of reputation are
essential to maintaining accessibility.

Technology Possibilities

In this use case, Darla is without any 'right to be forgotten', as her credit
history and financial activity are inevitably stored in conventional centralized
structures. Thus, the best she can do is provide verifiable stipulations
governing the exchange between herself and financial institutions. One
appropriate structure for this use case is a
[link contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_contract). Link contracts are
semantic structures intended for peer-to-peer communications for describing
agreements governning the disclosure, sharing, and lifetime of information made
available through networked channels. [XDI](http://xdi.org/), a non-profit
organization, maintains one standard for such link contracts.

If well-implemented by banks and credit rating agencies, link contracts could
enable users of financial systems to both efficiently detect possibly fraudulent
activity, as well as to dispute and address erroneous or malicious activity
associated with an account in a way that avoids information asymmetry. Link
contracts express stipulations of information governance in a transparent
fashion, appropriate for a system that intends to guard credit and credibility.

#### Concerns in Non-G20 Nations

In the The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails
Everywhere Else, Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto highlights a fundamental
difference between Western liberal democracies and other regions: such
democracies have functioning systems that enable the abstract representation of
value. For example, land is not simply owned territory--it is private property
registered with the state and represented by land deeds; the representation
having the force of law in disputes.

Millions of individuals do not have such representative records (birth
certificates etc.) registered with government entities, and such entities may
not be reliable enough to serve this role. Worse, many marginalized people may
either be prohibited from creating records that might enfranchise them, either
through legal exclusion or threats of violence. The Gates Foundation considers
this issue
[one of their 8 global priorities](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor):

> Worldwide, more than 2.5 billion adults do not have an account at a financial
> institution, according to the World Bank's Global Financial Inclusion
> Database. Only 41 percent of adults in developing economies have an
> account—and that number drops to just over 20 percent among adults living in
> extreme poverty. Women, in particular, are largely excluded from the formal
> financial system. In developing countries, only 37 percent of women have
> accounts, compared to 46 percent of men.

They also highlight research showing that "the most effective way to
significantly expand poor people's access to formal financial services is
through digital means."

With that in mind, consider the following use case:

Farhad is a migrant worker at a mine in, with no fixed address, yet receives a
regular wage in cash, which he would like to store in a secure account. He has
no recurring bills or credit bureau profile; yet turns up for work on time over
day, 6 days a week, 50 weeks a year, is known by multiple locations by the same
name and travels in the same geographies. He needs to be able to turn this
accumulated consistency into a portable, self-sovereign record of this economic
reliability that others can assess and verify, so he can store fiat currency,
pay bills, and gain access to credit.

Farhad is without state or financial institutional support, which changes the
dynamic from the previous case. On the other hand, the regulatory burden is
expected to be lower by the same token. What Farhad needs is a way to take the
same semi-informal exchanges mentioned in previous use cases and bundle them up
into a highly-available, privacy-respecting, verifiable record of credible
activity--the basic information required for a consumer-facing financial market.

A sketch of this is as follows:

1. An independent organization sets up a distributed store of data that can be
   reached by users like Farhad with minimal equipment (say, a low-grade
   smartphone with data).
2. Farhad bootstraps his financial record with verifiable records of work and
   other met commitments, in conjunction with clients, employers, and other
   financial actors in his sphere (cf. use case 2).
3. With this record (and possibly an associated cryptocurrency where needed),
   Farhad can now make both local and electronic purchases with increased
   leverage.
4. Financial service companies can now make anonymous queries a la Craigslist,
   sending offers to users who meet a raft of criteria. Farhad can choose to
   submit anonymous claims that he meets different criteria, allowing him to
   receive these offers or apply directly for loans and other financial
   aggreements directly.

With the rise of distributed computing, it is possible to use it to support
individuals like Farhad in representing themselves--allowing them at last a
self-sovereign identity that they create and control. Through it, they can link
together their interactions/transactions and leverage it to create an abstract
representation of themselves. This type of identity can empower unbanked people,
beginning with a 'secure kernel' of identity that is taken for granted by
holders of state-issued identity documents. Such a 'secure kernel' can allow the
accounting of, and provision for, basic social needs like health insurance and
credit--privileges in the Global North that are considered dire needs of
citizens in the Global South.

Under such a system, Farhad's records are not exposed to surveillance, nor to
(financial) corruption. At the same time, claims issued in that space, whether
negatively or positively affecting his reputation, are as verifiable as any
other transaction, preferably by any user. Transaction history is not revealed
to merchants or financial service providers, nor is activity. What is available
is a verifiable record of commitments--contracts and their fulfillment
status. NB: Mechanisms of
[differential privacy](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64346/dwork.pdf) may
be needed in this case, to prevent semi-aggregated queries from permanently
reducing the privacy of users whose data is contained in the store.

```[FOOTNOTE]: It is critical to understand the difference between this type of
self-sovereign identity is different then just anchoring transactions to a phone
number. Individuals DO NOT have control over phone number in the same
manner. Phone numbers are rented from the phone companies and are re-assigned
(given to someone new) when one stops paying one's bill.)```

### Use Case 4 - Starting From Zero: Refugee ###

Despite what is sometimes assumed, an individual's identity does not necessarily
derive from the state, despite the effects of practice and policy. Individuals
may receive identity documents from the state that enable/empower them to
interact with states over the lifecycles of the identities those documents
signify--in other words, identifying documents exist in a context. One way to
"prove" an identity is to present identity documents from a state, but what
happens when there isn't a functioning state to issue such documents, or an
individual is kept from obtaining them? Can an individual establish and maintain
a "self-sovereign" identity that can survive these circumstances and serve as a
conduit of interaction with public and private institutions?

Yevgeni is a member of a persecuted or targeted class in his nation of
citizenship and residence. He does not feel safe carrying identity documents
with him when he flees--information asserting his grounds for asylum must bypass
local centralized data stores, as it could be used to harm him (i.e., records
identifying or locating individuals could be seized by a new hostile regime).

In order to meet this need, a secure, privacy-respecting data store must be made
available to the legal jurisdiction of the host government. Since refugees often
move through multiple state territories, and would prefer to avoid setting out
new permanent personal records in a new nation under complete surveillance, said
data store should be maintained independently (as in the previous use cases)
from the states themselves.
 
Such a technology can empower Yevgeni to create a self-sovereign 'anchor' of
identity--whatever documentation or information he has can be stored as
statements or photographs to be used for claims later. A prospective host
government can poll the store, obtaining proof of identity attributes that only
he can access directly, satisfying the host government's documentation
requirements. Yevgeni is able to leave his country on the accepting government's
terms without excessive risk, and at immigration uses his self-sovereign
identity to enter.

In this case, a technical solution does not proceed in a simple step-by-step
fashion, but we can identify the chief needs:

- Safe onboarding of a potential refugee at xer current location (Humanitarian
  organizations can aid in this)
- Authentication methods that 'survive the trip' along with the refugee:
  passphrases if possible; at a minimum, not solely biometrics
- Partnerships with refugee-hosting governments and independent organizations
  maintaining the data store, backed by a policy-compliant API
- Functionality allowing refugee users to progress toward an independent status
  where they are hosted, along the lines of the previously introduced use cases

Commentary

People share social contexts; they are in community with each other, and through
social relations create webs of human connection. This can be made rigorous and
verifiable with self-sovereign identities held by each person, documented
digitally by mutual verification asserted cryptographically through a secure
digital medium. Creating this type of network to socially validate an identity
is why this aspect of the technology is called a **web of trust.**

This network of connection that can be documented securely between individual's
sovereign source identities could serve as another seed to bootstrap an identity
with a new jurisdiction and document circumstance. In other words, it is only
through a web of trust linking self-sovereign identities that someone in as dire
straits as a refugee can be credentialed to a degree acceptable by Global North
governments, while maintaining strong guarantees of security and privacy to all
stakeholders involved.

### Use Case 5 - Trafficking / Safe Houses ###

Marsha is a victim of human trafficking who has been rescued by a local group
and conveyed to a safe house. She may have an identity card/identifier issued to
her by the state - however she does not trust the local state actors/office
enough to present to them using it to access benefits (she may be re-victimized
by them if she does). An aid organization and/or government is willing to
provide resources (financial, food, education) to her and others like her, so
that she can re-normalize her life. We note that this is not a speculative
scenario; the 'digital quarantines' and surveillance pressures undergone by
women in shelters or sex work are
[documented in the reporting](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/sex-work-and-surveillance).

A caseworker provides Marsha with portable, manageable equipment for storing and
protecting identity attributes, and assists her with setting up core
attributes. Marsha then submits repeated proofs of her identity and (changing)
status for compliance purposes to the aid organization or government, which is
then able to account for the aid provided. When Marsha finally leaves the safe
house and resumes independent life, she is sure that her private information
leaves with her.

Marsha has the same technical needs as those explained in the previous use
cases. The unique challenge here is in handling existing 'toxic' components of
her existing identity: her traffickers may have access to a slew of credentials
up to and including digital ones, which may also link to friends or family. She
might like to reconnect with people or obtain access to stores of value in
existing accounts without risking further harm.

Thus, the main technical needs for Marsha's case are:

- A protocol for establishing a set of 'core' initial attributes
- Data stored in a completely independent location robust against threats
- Strong guarantees of only selective disclosure
- Desirable: A way to 'reconstruct' still-valued components of a previously
  poisoned or toxic identity (i.e. friends or relatives prior to event) without
  risking attack or subsequent victimization
- Clear threat models at every step of the process

The key to meeting these needs is to provide an individual services across time
and space, in a way that avoids duplication and provides for continuity of care
(medically)--in other words, persistent correlatable claims.  An independent
organization can issue these with the consent of the individual client,
achieving this result for the client without compromising her privacy. Thus
avoiding touching the formal state systems that she mistrusts.

In other words, the independent organization is dis-intermediating the state
issuance of identity documents/identifiers. This is useful when a local state
actor/office is mistrusted by Marsha. She is willing to have the independent
organization mediate the provision of support services to her via government aid
from a different department of level of government.

## Discussion

### Opportunities/Unsolved problems

The use cases presented above share a host of common themes and characteristics:
portability, security, privacy, autonomy, and universality, among others. Any
identity system that exemplifies these will almost inevitably become the basis
for an unprecedented expansion in economic and social activity. In order to
realize such a system, challenges in technical, political, and human spheres
must be surmounted. Each of these challenges, of course, provides an opportunity
to create value.

#### Technical

- Manageable and portable equipment for storing identity information and making
  strong claims with precise scope and context-limited disclosure
- Decentralized data stores and secure APIs that share a minimal set of
  operations and content types
- API implementations in an open, auditable form in well-maintained,
  cross-platform languages (targeting mobile and desktop OSes)
- Repudiable biometrics
  
#### Political

- A negotiated concordance between amount of information provided by
  uncredentialed persons, and the amount initially required by conventional
  institutions
- Partnerships with local authorities for education, implementation, and
  outreach
- Support structures for independent data providers, independent audits, and
  user onboarding (hardware) across the world

#### Human

- Behavioral protcols that swap in 'proof of X' for 'X' in (all) transactions
  where someone's identifiers are requested, as a rule
- Bootstrapping/onboarding/enrollment from self-affirmed identity attributes,
  expressed in a fashion intelligible to all potential users

### Near-term prospects

Although the demands illustrated by the use cases we present are quite serious,
we note that there have never been so many legally unencumbered technical and
expert resources for this application as there are at present. We believe that
the main challenges ahead are those of systems integration and widespread
adoption, for which the prospects are good. Given adequate funding, we are
certain that the challenges illustrated above can be met, with good outcomes
throughout the process.

Moreover, we recognize that we are presented with an unprecedented historical
opportunity--the evolution not only of the internet as infrastructure but a
turning point of human culture. Development of self-sovereign identities rooted
in a decentralized, distributed, verifiable data store can usher in a world
where, for the first time in history, identities can be represented and
communicated in a fashion that transcends any centralized authority,
enfranchising every actor in the system as a unique person, community, company
or government. Through these identities, any actor, regardless of origin, can
obtain the assurances they need to operate and engage in interactions that
require persistance across time and space--a record of continuous commitments
that will underlie incredible economic and social improvements for humankind.

Privacy-respecting, secure (in the senses defined above) distributed systems are
uniquely able to both accurately chart this experience, as well as empower us to
foster or develop identities that have never been possible before. While this is
great news from a technological standpoint, the same systems can certainly also
be employed in a coercive manner. At worst, large-scale information systems,
whether centralized databases with essentially unlimited storage or
decentralized append-only structures, if mobilized at the will of a single
interest group, could near-permanently foreclose the disjoint, varied, and
possibly contradictory nascent identities of masses of people going
forward. (Imagine if a government ID system was coupled with an undeniable
append-only log, fed by a ubiquitous surveillance system--then place it at
different points in history.) We have a grave responsibility to implemement
these systems in an ethical and forward-thinking manner--doing so will preserve
the largest possible potential to future generations.
